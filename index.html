<title>Hack CFA</title>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Hack CFA</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is a brand new competition at Carnegie Mellon sponsored by the Mellon College of Science. Students will be able to submit 
their design proposals for a new sculpture on campus that says something about the world of science. The winning group will then receive $1000 to fund their 
project! The sculpture will be displayed on campus for one year (until the next Hack CFA) and then be donated to a nearby school.</p>
