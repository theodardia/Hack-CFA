<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Hack CFA</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is a brand new competition at Carnegie Mellon sponsored by the Mellon College of Science. Students will be able to submit 
    their design proposals for a new sculpture on campus that says something about the world of science. The winning group will then receive $1000 to fund 
    their project! The sculpture will be displayed on campus for one year (until the next Hack CFA) and then be donated to a nearby school.</p>

<p>Rules and Requirements:</p>
<ul>Teams are made up of 4-8 students, but at least one has to be from the College of Fine Arts and at least one from the Mellon College of Science.</ul>
<ul>Each team must submit a paragraph prosopal, a detailed sketch of the proposed sculpture with dimensions, a list of materials, a timeline of expected 
    deadlines, and the estimated cost.</ul>
<ul>The judges will then determine whether or not your prosopal is feasable and able to withstand outdoor condiitons. Then they will decide a winner.</ul>
